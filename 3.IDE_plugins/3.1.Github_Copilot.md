- üëÄ Non-publicly available feature: [automatic Copilot PR review](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/code-review/using-copilot-code-review#enabling-automatic-reviews-from-copilot)

## Downsides

- Many useful features should be explicitly enabled in personal settings.
  For example, to search the Web enable [Copilot Bing search](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-copilot-as-an-individual-subscriber/managing-copilot-policies-as-an-individual-subscriber#enabling-or-disabling-web-search-for-github-copilot-chat)
- Some features are not obvious, for example to explicitly search Web after it is enables, some need to include two specific tags `@github #web Your question?`.  
- Many features are in preview.
  For example, to try `Code Review` feature the organization should be approved by Microsoft, and approved from the [waiting list](https://github.com/github-copilot/code-review-waitlist).
- Github Copilot integration to Github is only available for the Enterprise organization plan.
- Chat window: developer always need to be aware of the current Copilot `context`, and not forget to use `@workspace` and other tags.
- It will be possible soon to code review only stashed changes. See [VSCode insider demo](https://youtu.be/qHbVEDNMdGE?t=214).
