# Continue dev

[Continue dev](https://github.com/continuedev/continue) is an open-source IDE plugin for VSCode and Jetbrains.

It does not provide any model or AI features out of the box. Requires a model to be configured.

## Features
- Can use almost any popular LLM model in cloud.
  For example, if you have ChatGPT subscription, this plugin is away better than official ChatGPT plugins.
  Continue.dev can use GPT models with the provided OpenAI key.
- ðŸ”¥ Can use any model locally.
  The most secure (!) scenario without making any internet requests.
