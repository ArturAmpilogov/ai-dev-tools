## Examples

- Monitor GMail for email containing "XYZ", send personalized answer
- Search for the best viewpoints during a trip, search for the cheapest hotel accommodation in multiple sites (can use your discounts), book hotels, add events to the calendar (GCalendar or iCalendar in Mac).
- Download a file from a site, unzip, open the folder in VSCode, etc.
- Inspect video with re-construction place. Consider how safe it is. Claude was able to do screenshots, recognize objects, created a spreadsheet and described for each object how safe it is with international safety score and description, then accumulated the result.

## Downsides

- Beta feature but feels like alpha. A bit [complicated setup](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-quickstarts/tree/main/computer-use-demo).
- Can hallucinate
- Can stop processing due an error
