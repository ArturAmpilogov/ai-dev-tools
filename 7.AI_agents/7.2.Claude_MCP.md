# Claude agents

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a new open standard for connecting LLMs to tools, data, and dev environments.

[Claude MCP](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol) allows to integrate third party service as agents.

## Demo
[Demo](https://youtu.be/5CmAKm1wWW0?t=756) shows how to integrate Web search and Github to the Claude Desktop application via MCP.

Then it is possible to run a query:
- Crate a new Github repository
- Generate a site
- Test that it is working locally.
- Create a PR.

Also:
- Create a Github issue where "..."
- Fix the issue.
- Create a PR with the fix in a special format.


Claude agent will do the task step by step.

## Services

Many services are already available for integration: Google Drive, Slack, GitHub, Git, Postgres, Puppeteer.

## More examples

Anthropic, company that develops Claude, had [a hackaton in San Francisco](https://x.com/AlexReibman/status/1866737908331450653).

What people built:

- [Holiday shopping agent](https://x.com/AlexReibman/status/1866738598390935561/video/1)
  Claude assistant powered by Browserbase Stagehand that finds holiday gift ideas on NYT Wirecutter and buys them on Amazon

- [AI product manager](https://x.com/AlexReibman/status/1866738598390935561/video/2)
  AI agent built by connecting Claude to Linear and automatically writes Product requirements documents (PRDs), creates tasks, and ranks them by difficulty.

- [Claude learning how to query Stripe on its own](https://x.com/AlexReibman/status/1866739270205227164)
   Claude learns Stripe API. Then able to perform tasks, like "find Stripe charges for the customer abc@xyz.com", "charge back the customer", and so on.


## Downsides

- The agent can make mistakes which can be unpredictable.
  For example, having almost full Git repository access, what if the agent deletes all repositories behind the scene?
  What if it will start to spam wrong persons in LinkedIn or write some strange messages?
