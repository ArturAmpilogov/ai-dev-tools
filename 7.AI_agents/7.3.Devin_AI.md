# Devin AI

[Devin AI](https://devin.ai/) is an attempt to create a general-purpose AI for developers.

## Features
- Create a new project from scratch, including a new git repository.
- Clone existing project to the cloud environment and start working on it in the "Devin's workspace tool".

  This is not possible with local IDEs.
