# Vercel

Vercel provides [V0](https://v0.dev/) which allows to build components and pages based on screenshots and Figma files.

## Features
- Prompt to Component or Page generation
- Image to Component generation
- A component can be added via `npx shadcn@latest add {your-v0-url}` command.

## Limitations
- Specific to ShadCN code style (created by the ShadCN author): Tailwind CSS, Radix UI, React, TypeScript, ShadCN components.
- No support for your code base. For example, can generate `{Array.from({ length: 7 }).map((_, i) => <Some component />` that should be replaced manually with custom parameters.
